Dear Mistral team,
I would like to offer my 10+ years of experience in full-stack development and management of engineering teams, from general tech architecture planning to detailed front-end and back-end work.  
I imagine continuing my engineering journey within an ambitious team to tackles the business and technological challenges of tomorrow, a team I could learn from and contribute to. If you believe I could fit there, I would love to have a longer chat, to get to know each other, to understand what are the problems you are looking at, and how I could support !
Regards,
Adrian Villa


Dear Signal team,

I would like to offer my 10+ years of experience in full-stack development and management of engineering teams. My recent work involved hiring and leading teams to build scalable GraphQL APIs (with Python and Django) while building front-end applications consuming this interface with React, Relay and Typescript, always with a focus on successful collaboration, planning, code quality and maintainability.
Today, I am looking forward to continuing my engineering journey within an ambitious team to tackles the business and technological challenges of tomorrow, a team I could learn from and contribute to. 

I have been an avid user of the Signal platform for the past 4 years, which is for me aligned in terms of philosphy and values. I would be a great honor to be able to be part of it.

If you see my experience to be relevant to you, I would love to have a longer chat, to meet each other, understand what are the problems at hand, and how I could support !

Sincerely,
Adrian Villa
