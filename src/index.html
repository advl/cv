        <p>
          I'm a self-taught software engineer, with my programming journey
          starting back in 1999. After graduating in Management and
          Entrepreneurship at HEC Paris, my work involved leading teams to build
          and sustain efficient tech stacks, fostering a culture where
          collaboration and engineering excellence are key to achieve sizeable
          organization impact. I am currently located in Berlin, Germany.
          <!--I've also successfully
          led and overhauled cross-functional departments such as People, Sales,
          and Marketing. As I believe in an alliance between business and
          technology, I'm intrigued by the potential of AI, seeing it as a
          opportunity for both quality and speed in software development. I am
          eager to join a team that shares values of curiosity, resourcefulness,
          ambition, and a commitment to solving impactful business and
          engineering challenges, remotely or in Berlin.-->
