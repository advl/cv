        <p>
          I'm a Business and Entrepreneurship graduate from HEC Paris and a
          self-taught software engineer, with my programming journey starting
          back in 1999. As an engineering manager, I've strategically guided
          teams in developing and maintaining robust technology stacks to
          support business growth, while nurturing a culture of mutual support
          and engineering excellence. I've also successfully created and led
          cross-functional teams, managing departments such as People, Sales,
          and Marketing, and spearheaded the introduction of a remote, flexible
          work culture that improved collaboration and productivity for over 100
          employees. I am eager to join a team that shares values of curiosity,
          resourcefulness, ambition, and a commitment to solving impactful
          business and engineering challenges, remotely or in Berlin.
